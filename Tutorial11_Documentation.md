# Recap on common terms:
## Devried attribute:
- It is a data that **depends/devrived** (or can be **calculated**) on another data. For instance:
- To calculate our _current age_, we need to know one's _year of birth_. 

### Design pattern:
- It will usually have the following componenets:
```java
getYearofBirth()
  //TODO: code here
getAge(int YearofBirth()
  //TODO: code here
 
 setYearOfBirth()
 //
 getYearOfBirth()
 
 ```
 - However, there are a lot of problems wi
 - We could do in a short way:
 ```java
 ```
 - BUT, it could go wrong very, very fast...
 ### Mr.Teacher decend into madness over
 
 
 ### A better, non-Vinmart design
 ```java
getYearofBirth()
  //TODO: code here
getAge(int YearofBirth()
  //TODO: code here
 
 setYearOfBirth()
 //

// instead of set year of birth, we would build a 
private computerAge(int YearOfBirth)
//
 
 ```
